# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to look at past kickstarter campaigns and their outcomes in relation to launch dates and funding goals so that Louise can determine how her fundraising campaign is performing compared to comparable kickstarter campaigns. We did this by trying to understand the relationship between timing of launching a kickstarter campaign and what the outcomes were based on the timing, specifically looking at theater campaigns. We also needed to look at the total amount of kickstarter campaigns and how many of those were successful or not (canceled or failed) in relation to their goal amounts.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Theater campaigns were most successful when originally launched in May and June and least successful when launched in November through January. For those that are not successful, Theater campaigns overall fail signifigantly more than being canceled, when launched in any given month of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Kickstarter campaigns were most successful when the goal amount was below $15,000 and least successful when the goal amount was over 45,000. 



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I did not encounter any challenges. One potential challenge that I can see is not setting up the countifs formula correctly because it becomes more complicated the more criteria you have to put in it. A greater than or equal to sign could be easily mis-typed or the cell ranges could shift and be off if you just copied and pasted formulas over.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

    1. Based off of this data, one can extract that theater campaigns are more successful when launched in        the summer seasons versus the winter seasons.
    2. Overall, launch date has a greater impact on number of successful outcomes than non-succesful              outcomes, as the failed and canceled outcomes are more even throughout the year whereas succesful          outcomes spike when launched in certain months. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

    Kickstarter campaigns are more likely to fail as goal amount increases and more likely to succeed as       the goal amount decreases. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

    Limited sample size meaning it does not represent the entire universe of kickstarter campaigns in every     country of the world. Also limited sources since this may only come from one source and not all             kickstarter sources.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

    Which parent categories are more likely to succeed based on location.
    Which parent categories are more successful based on goal amount.
    Which parent categories raise more money overall.
